Create a machine learning model that can estimate carbon stock/sequestration\n2. Input features: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), canopy cover percentage, soil carbon data\n3. Output: Carbon sequestration in tCO\u2082e (tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent) per hectare\n4. Provide model training, validation, and prediction capabilities\n5. Include data preprocessing, feature engineering if needed\n6. Save the model and create a demonstration/testing interface\n7. Provide model performance metrics and visualization of results\n\nSave all outputs including the trained model, code, and documentation in the /workspace directory.", "task_type": "general", "code": "", "result": "", "is_success": false, "is_finished": false, "assignee": "David", "start_at": 1756280510.0107443}], "current_task_id": "1"}
